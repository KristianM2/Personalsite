            <h1>United States Army</h1>
            <p>I am a veteran with a proud history of service in the United States Army. During my time in the Army, I held the role of an 88M, specializing as a Motor Transport Operator. 
                This experience instilled in me a deep sense of discipline, responsibility, and teamwork. 
                I had the privilege of working alongside dedicated colleagues and serving my country with the utmost commitment. 
                My military service remains a significant part of my life, and the lessons I learned during my time in the Army continue to shape my values and work ethic.

            <h1>Fitness</h1>
            <p>In addition to my military background, I have a strong passion for fitness, particularly powerlifting. I find that the gym is not just a place to work out; 
                it's a sanctuary where I challenge myself physically and mentally. Whether it's setting new personal records, fine-tuning my lifting technique, or helping others on their fitness journey, 
                I derive immense satisfaction from my time at the gym. It's not only about lifting weights; it's about pushing boundaries, setting goals, and maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle. 
                Fitness has become an integral part of my daily routine, and I'm constantly seeking new ways to improve and share my knowledge and enthusiasm with others.
